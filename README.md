# DragonBot DND Discord Bot
The main goal of this project so far has been to learn how to implement the new libraries that I am becoming familiar with, so there are some sections of code that are placeholders and definitely don't exhibit great coding practice.

## Current Features
 - `Rolling Dice`
 - `Creating character sheets`
 - `Managing encounters`

## Planned Features

 - `Character import from DndBeyond`
 - `Writing a python module to prevent rebuilding project with each update`
 - `Admins creating their own runnable python lambda functions to increase versatility`
 - `Public servers to allow free hosting of the DragonBot (Requires a security overhaul)`
